# Chasing Waterfalls: An Iceland Road Trip Adventure

Iceland—land of fire and ice, where glaciers meet volcanoes, and waterfalls are so numerous that locals barely notice them. My ten-day road trip around the Ring Road was an adventure I'll never forget.

## The Journey Begins: Reykjavik

Landing in **Reykjavik**, I was immediately struck by how clean and colorful the city was. Rainbow-painted buildings lined the streets, and the air was impossibly fresh.

### First Impressions

- Surprisingly mild weather (in summer)
- Midnight sun—it never got truly dark
- Incredibly expensive everything
- Friendly, English-speaking locals

## Day 1-2: The Golden Circle

The **Golden Circle** is Iceland's most popular route, and for good reason:

### Thingvellir National Park

Standing between two continental plates—literally. You can walk between North America and Europe here. The historical significance as Iceland's first parliament site adds another layer to this geological wonder.

### Geysir Geothermal Area

Watching **Strokkur** geyser erupt every 5-10 minutes never got old. The anticipation, the rumbling, the explosive burst of boiling water shooting 30 meters high—nature's perfect show.

### Gullfoss Waterfall

My first major Icelandic waterfall. The raw power as glacial water thunders down into a canyon was humbling. The spray created constant rainbows in the sunlight.

## Day 3-4: The South Coast

The **South Coast** is where Iceland really shows off:

### Seljalandsfoss

A waterfall you can walk behind! Standing behind the curtain of water, feeling the mist on your face, hearing the roar—surreal doesn't begin to describe it.

### Skogafoss

Massive, powerful, and photogenic. I climbed the 500+ steps to the top for a different perspective. Both views were worth it.

### Black Sand Beach (Reynisfjara)

The black volcanic sand, towering basalt columns, and powerful waves created an otherworldly atmosphere. This was where I truly felt I'd left Earth behind.

> "Warning: Sneaker waves are real. Pay attention to the safety signs. I saw waves unexpectedly surge 50 meters up the beach."

## Day 5-6: The East Fjords

The **East Fjords** are Iceland's hidden gem—fewer tourists, stunning scenery:

- Winding roads along cliff edges
- Tiny fishing villages
- Puffin colonies (adorable!)
- Peace and quiet

The drive was slow but spectacular. Every turn revealed a new fjord, each more beautiful than the last.

## Day 7-8: The North

### Myvatn Lake Area

This geothermal area felt like another planet:

- **Hverir**: Bubbling mud pots and steaming vents
- **Dimmuborgir**: Lava formations straight out of fantasy
- **Myvatn Nature Baths**: Like the Blue Lagoon but less crowded and cheaper

### Dettifoss

Europe's most powerful waterfall. The ground literally shook as I approached. The sheer volume of water plummeting into the canyon was incomprehensible.

### Godafoss

The "Waterfall of the Gods" lived up to its name—graceful, powerful, and mythical.

## Day 9: Akureyri

Iceland's "capital of the north" was a charming town with:

- Great restaurants (finally!)
- Botanical gardens
- Cozy cafes
- Mountain views

A welcome break from driving and camping.

## Day 10: Return to Reykjavik

The final stretch back to Reykjavik took me through:

- **Hvitserkur**: A striking rock formation
- **Hraunfossar**: Waterfalls flowing from beneath a lava field
- More incredible landscapes that seemed endless

## The Northern Lights

On my last night, the forecast showed high auroral activity. Around 11 PM, the sky began to dance.

Green ribbons of light swirled overhead, pulsing and shifting. Photos don't do it justice—you have to see it to believe it. I stood in the freezing cold for hours, mesmerized.

### Tips for Seeing the Lights

1. **Dark skies**: Get away from light pollution
2. **Clear weather**: Check the forecast
3. **Patience**: They don't always show up on schedule
4. **KP index**: Higher numbers mean better chances
5. **Camera ready**: Long exposures capture what eyes sometimes miss

## Practical Tips

### Driving in Iceland

- **Weather changes fast**: Check road conditions daily
- **F-roads**: Need 4WD, closed until summer
- **Gas stations**: Can be far apart, fill up often
- **Speed limits**: Enforced by speed cameras
- **Gravel roads**: Slow down! Seriously.

### Accommodation

- **Camping**: Cheapest option, many campgrounds
- **Hostels**: Good for meeting travelers
- **Hotels**: Expensive but comfortable
- **Book ahead**: Especially in summer

### Food

- **Expensive**: $20+ for a basic meal
- **Grocery stores**: Bonus and Kronan are cheapest
- **Hot dogs**: The famous Reykjavik hot dog stand is worth it
- **Try local**: Skyr (yogurt), lamb, fish

### Budget

Iceland is expensive. Period. Budget roughly:

- Accommodation: $50-150/night
- Food: $50-80/day
- Gas: $100+/day (depending on driving)
- Activities: $50-200 each

## Lessons Learned

### Pack

- **Layers**: Weather changes hourly
- **Waterproof everything**: Rain is common
- **Sunglasses**: For driving in low sun
- **Swimsuit**: Hot springs everywhere

### Expect the Unexpected

- Roads close without warning
- Weather forecasts are suggestions
- Travel times double what Google says
- Every detour leads to beauty

## Final Thoughts

Iceland is a photographer's paradise, an adventurer's dream, and a nature lover's heaven. It's expensive, unpredictable, and absolutely worth every penny and moment.

The landscapes are so dramatic they don't look real. The waterfalls are so numerous you start rating them. The weather is so changeable you experience all four seasons in a day.

### What Made It Special

- The raw, untouched nature
- The sense of isolation and freedom
- The midnight sun and endless days
- The Northern Lights dancing overhead
- The friendly locals
- The feeling of being on another planet

Iceland isn't just a destination—it's a reminder of nature's power and beauty, a place where you feel simultaneously tiny and connected to something vast.

### Would I Go Back?

Absolutely. I barely scratched the surface. The Westfjords, the Highlands, winter landscapes—there's so much more to explore.
