In the article, we will be building an admin dashboard that will help us manage the product data of a balloon's store website.
![products.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1623737585900/kf-1uvKk3.png)
The above image is a website's product page that fetches data from a google sheet acting as a database.
Our admin dashboard will use google sheets APIs to modify data.
#### Admin dashboard basic features:- 
1. Create a new product. ( Insert a row )
2. Modify existing product details. (modify a row)
3. Remove product. (delete a row )

We will use appsmith's platform to build this dashboard.

## 🤔 What is Appsmith?

Appsmith is an open-source framework to build admin panels, CRUD apps, and workflows. Build everything you need, 10x faster.

sounds cool? Let's build and see.



### 1. Create a datasource 💽
In this case, `datasource` is a google sheet so let's create a new sheet.

![Screenshot 2021-06-15 at 12.19.32 PM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1623740018881/GLJ-XZtMj_.png)

here we created a sheet for `products` with the column as 
```
"product_id" ,  // unique id 
"category_type", // product categories type like "BALLOON" or "FIREWORKS" or some other
"product_name", // name of the product
"product_desp" , // about the product
"product_cost" , // cost of the product
"product_stock", // stock quantity of product 
"product_img_link" // image url
``` 

### 2. Integrate datasource to appsmith app

when you create a new appsmith app, you will find yourself here.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1623741556622/0b_GU2Gsw.png)
Click on Import APIs -> Choose Google Sheet -> Fill in the details.
It will add google sheet as a datasource and route to create a new API.

> Refer [Appsmith's docs](https://docs.appsmith.com/datasource-reference/querying-google-sheets) to know more about google sheet integration.

### 3. Fetch data and generate widget to show UI 

To get all the rows of the `products` sheet fill in the details as following
- methods:  `fetch sheet rows`
- spreadsheet URL: paste your google sheet URL
- sheet name: `products` 

![Untitled design.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1623743329440/M5F8SQhEe.png)

After a successful response from the API, click on `Generate Widget` to create a table rendering response data in a table.

### 4. Modify data using Form 🔨

To create or update data in a row we will create a `Form` widget with an input field for each row of data respective to its type.
![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1623756084894/P-Zbh1Bea.png)

here I have created a `Form` called Modify Product with input field as follows -

```
// widget_name `<WidgetType>` = {{defaultValue}}
- Product Image `<Image>`  =  `{{appsmith.store.uploaded_image_link || productTable.selectedRow.product_img_link}}`
- ImageURLInput  `<Text>` = `{{productTable.selectedRow.product_img_link || demo_image_URL}}`
- product_name_input `<Text>` = `{{productTable.selectedRow.product_name || ''}}`
- product_category_input `<Select>` = `{{productTable.selectedRow.product_name || ''}}`
- product_desc_input `<Text>` = `{{productTable.selectedRow.product_name || ''}}`
- product_stock_input `<Text>` = `{{productTable.selectedRow.product_name || ''}}`
- product_cost_input `<Text>` = `{{productTable.selectedRow.product_name || ''}}`
- product_row_index `<Text>` = `{{productTable.selectedRow.product_name || productTable.tableData.length}}`
``` 

Refer the [docs](https://docs.appsmith.com/widget-reference/table) if you aren't familiar with read value syntax like `productTable.selectedRow.column_name` mentioned above.


`appsmith.store.uploaded_image_link` is used to read a value from the appsmith store.

Check more about the appsmith store [here](https://docs.appsmith.com/framework-reference/store-value). 

#### Create a new row

When a table row is not selected, we would assume that the user will fill `Form` to create a new product i.e., a new row.
In that case, we will need to create an API to insert a new row in google sheets.

- createProduct API
![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1623847297678/6WOpFZGVG.png)

#### Update an existing row

- updateProduct API
![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1623847546411/uFDRimaA1.png)

After both the APIs are created successfully. Now on click of the `Submit` button in `Form`, we would call these APIs according to the task.

`Submit Button's` onClick actions :-

```js
onClick = {{
Number(product_row_index.text) <= productTable.tableData.length - 1 ? 
updateProduct.run(
    // After successful  
	() => getProducts.run(
    // clear
	   () => storeValue("uploaded_image_link","")  
), () => {})
: createProduct.run(
	() => getProducts.run(
		() => storeValue("uploaded_image_link","") 
), () => {})
}}
```

####  To Delete an existing row 

Create a delete button inside the table as a new column and on click of which call deleteProductAPI

- deleteProduct API

![Screenshot 2021-06-20 at 12.16.40 PM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624171611200/i0ilO4UP6.png)


### 5. Upload Image using Cloudinary 🌩

To upload an image to appsmith, we will use the `Filepicker` widget as shown below.

![Screenshot 2021-06-17 at 12.19.38 AM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1623869432990/28bKft3ai.png)

After this, I preferred adding an upload button separately on click of which we will upload selected image to cloudinary.

Now let's create an account in cloudinary and get your `cloud_name` and `upload_preset` which can be used to upload images using appsmith.

![Screenshot 2021-06-17 at 12.26.27 AM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1623869891881/65HeDTjcX.png)

Now let's create an API to upload the image.
- #### uploadImageAPI

Fill in the details as shown below.
`FilePicker1` is a reference to the `FilePicker` widget.
![Screenshot 2021-06-17 at 12.18.00 AM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1623870070049/QwhYWcany.png)

Now, we can run `uploadImageAPI` when the upload Image button is clicked.

```js
onClick = {{ 
  uploadImageAPI.run(
    (response) => {
      /* onSuccess */
      storeValue("uploaded_image_link",response.url);
      // here, we store the value which is then read using {{appsmith.store.uploaded_image_link}}
    },
    (response) => {
      /* onError */
    },
  )
}}
```

And it's done. 🎉🥳

That's how it looks. 🧐🤩
