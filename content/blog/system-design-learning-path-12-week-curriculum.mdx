## Tips for Success

1. **Read actively** — Take notes, draw diagrams, question assumptions
2. **Build something every week** — Theory without practice is incomplete
3. **Write public blog posts** — Teaching is the best way to learn
4. **Join study groups** — Find accountability partners on Twitter/Discord
5. **Review previous weeks** — Spaced repetition solidifies learning
6. **Apply to your work** — Look for opportunities to use these patterns in your day job

---

## Conclusion

This 12-week curriculum gives you the foundation to confidently discuss system design in interviews and build scalable systems in practice. By completing both books and implementing projects, you'll understand not just *what* works, but *why* it works.

**Remember:** System design is not about memorizing solutions—it's about understanding trade-offs, asking good questions, and making informed decisions.

Start Week 1 today. Share your progress. Build in public. Good luck! 🚀
